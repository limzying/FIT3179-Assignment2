                <h2>Internet users around the world</h2>
                <p>
                    Internet users are individuals who have used the internet from any places around the world.
                    As of April 2022, more than 63.1 % of the world's population which is equivalent to 5.03 billion of people are found to be using Internet. 
                    Internet connects billions of people globally and can be said as the key factor of modern society today. 
                    It is quite difficult to imagine life without access to the internet.
                    Do you ever wonder how many internet users does each country have?
                    This map shows the internet users per 100 population for countries in the world in year 2022.

                    <h2>Do you know what are the top 10 countries with most internet users?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The amount of internet users has been increasing rapidly. From the bar chart on the left,
                        we can see that the top 10 countries with the highest amount of internet users are China, 
                        India, United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, Pakistan and Japan.
                        These countries contribute the most to the total number of internet users in the world.

                    <p>
                        We can observe that the total internet users of the top 10 countries are all over 100 million and                
                        China even have more than 1 billion which is 70.8% of its population.

                    <h2>How many internet plans are available?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are various types of internet plans available in every country and most of them are different 
                        in terms of several factors such as the price and speed.
                        Users are allowed to subscribe to any type of internet plans based on their own preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since there are a lot of different internet plans offered in each country, let's begin to explore by grouping them based on continents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the graph on the left, we can observe the average number of internet plans available for each of the continents.
                        There are 50 internet plans offered in North America on average which is the highest and the lowest would be Caribbean which only offers 14 internet plans.

                    <h2>Lets have a look at the price per 1GB of internet</h2>
                    <p>
                        The price per 1GB of internet for each internet plans are different and to better analyse the data, let's group the countries into continents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the graph on the left, Europe is having the widest price range which is from $0.49 to $51.70. 
                        Therefore, we can conclude that the price of each internet plans offered in each countries in Europe differs a lot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides, South America has relatively small price range which is from $0.62 to $7.71.
                        So, we can tell that the price of each internet plans offered in each countries in South America doesn't differ much.

                    <h2>Is internet speed and internet user rate related?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Do you ever wonder if the number of internet users in the country affects the speed of the internet?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By looking at the scatter plot, we can say that the internet speed and the internet user rate are positive correlated. 
                        The higher the internet user rate, the higher the average internet speed of the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is because as the number of users increases, the internet providers have to improve the quality of the internet such as the speed in order to fulfill the demand of the market. 
                        This ensures the stability of the internet in the country.
